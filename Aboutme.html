    <h2>Rebecca Hanks</h2>
    <p>Hi! I'm Rebecca and I am majoring in Web Design and Development. I love to read, workout, listen to music, and do anything outdoors. I have six other siblings and my family moves around pretty often but they just recently moved to Rexburg! I love BYU-Idaho's special spirit that we have here. Even though the winters are rough, I do love them for a limited time and I LOVE the summers.</p>
